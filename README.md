# Carbon Footprint Analyzer

This project analyzes the carbon footprint of websites based on their page size and estimated CO2 emissions.

## Backend

The backend is built using **Node.js** and **MongoDB**. It provides API endpoints to calculate CO2 emissions based on a website's page size, stores the results in a MongoDB database, and sends email notifications to users with their analysis.

### Features
- Calculate CO2 emissions based on page size.
- Store results in MongoDB.
- Send email with the analysis report.

### Setup for Backend
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install



### Breakdown:
- **Backend Section:** Describes the backend, including features and setup instructions. This is the main section for a backend-focused project.
- **Frontend Section:** If you have a frontend (e.g., React), you can include a section for it, detailing how to set it up and run it.
- **General Information:** A brief project description and license section.
- The final section includes a general summary about both the frontend and backend.

If you have **only a backend** at the moment, you can omit the "Frontend" section and focus solely on the backend setup and functionality. If you eventually add a frontend, just include the respective section for it.
